1 Technical Brief
For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a propositional and first
order logic tableau, using Python. Your program will be run on an unseen
input file and tested against its corresponding model output. Your program
will be expected to correctly identify the type of a propositional/first order
logic formula, and identify whether it is satisfiable, not satisfiable, or (in the
case of FOL tableau) satisfiablility cannot be determined after introducing 10
new constants in the δ-expansions on any given open branch.
Below we define both the language of propositional and first order logic. We
limit our propositional letters to p, q, r, s, and our binary connectives to con junctions, disjunctions, and implications. White space or extra brackets are not
allowed in formulas.
FMLA := PROP (Proposition)
| ~FMLA (Negation)
| (FMLA*FMLA) (Binary Connective)
PROP := p|q|r|s * := &|\/|-> (and, or, implies)
Similarly for FOL, we limit our variables to x, y, z, w, no function symbols,
and the only predicates are binary predicates P, Q, R, S.
var := x|y|z|w
PRED := P|Q|R|S * := &|\/|->
FMLA := PRED(var,var) (Atom)
| ~FMLA (Negation)
| EvarFMLA (Existentially Quantified)
| AvarFMLA (Universally Quantified)
| (FMLA*FMLA) (Binary Connective)
To see some examples, see the sample input/output file. The input file should
have the first line containing PARSE in order for the program to produce parser
output, or SAT to produce satisfiability output (or both). The remaining lines
should be propositional or first order formulas.

If a formula is parsed as a formula, you should construct a Tableau and
see if it has an open branch. For propositional formulas, you will be asked to
determine whether or not it is satisfiable. For first order logic formulas, you
may assume there are no free variables. You will be asked to try and determine
satisfiability, however, the tableau might never close. Thus, if you are required
to add more than 10 new constants on all open branches under some reasonable
fair schedule, you may leave satisfiability undetermined.
2 Assessment Criteria
You must submit a single file, tableau.py that must be able to run as is on the
lab machines using the below command, provided there is an input.txt file in the
same directory.
python3 tableau.py > output.txt
A test will pass if and only if the output.txt file matches the model output
file. If your program does not finish computing within a minute, it will timeout
and the test will fail. You will be awarded marks according to the table below:
Task Marks
Correctly parse propositional formulas 20
Correctly determine SAT for propositional formulas 20
Correctly parse first order logic formulas 20
Correctly determine SAT for FOL sentences that will
not result in a loop under any schedule.
20
Correctly determine SAT for any FOL sentence, up
to assigning 10 variables
20
Your final grade will be the sum of the marks for each section’s test.
IMPORTANT:
• Your file must not include any import statements. If your submission
contains an import statement, it will be considered as cheating, you will
receive a mark of 0.
• All submissions must be submitted as a single plain ASCII encoded file
named tableau.py that uses either CRLF or LF line endings. Failure to
adhere to the submission format requirements will additionally result in
your receipt of a 0 mark. All of these settings can be easily set in Visual
Studio Code and we suggest you set them there.
• You must use the template file skeleton.py as a starting point for the
coursework. This is for your convenience. We will not provide you with
any assistance if you choose to not use this template.

• You must not modify anything below the commented line which says
DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE BELOW THIS LINE!
Modifying the code below this line may lead to your coursework not working as intended and thus getting a mark lower than that which you might
expect (including a 0 mark).
